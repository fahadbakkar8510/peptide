# Description
This is my first product, starting my career as a WebGL developer. It's MVP of peptide simulation, and I used Vue.js (Front-End), Three.js (WebGL), and Ammo.js (Physics) to build it.
At a glimpse, it looks a bit simple, but it's built with all WebGL tech stacks (Shading Language, Multi Mesh Instance, Texturing, and so on), clean code, and deep physical concepts using Ammo.js
I'm proud to build this project as my first one.
